# Craft Twig starter
This is a basic blog starter project for creating Craft CMS using the native Twig templating language. It's a simple install that requires no database dump and no npm and only uses one first-party plugin (CKeditor).

## Features
* A single for globals
* A home page single
* A blog single with articles channel and category structure
* A guestbook single with guestbook entries channel
* A pages structure for additional pages and subpages
* A Cloud-ready assets volume

The Entries sidebar has also been configured to make these pages and sections easier to find for this setup.
